    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression\n",
    "------------\n",
    "Logistic regression is a commonly used and interpretable classification algorithm. I have a strong interest in deep learning applications, which use layers of \"artificial neurons\" to learn features from data. For deep learning models used in classification tasks, the final layer is typically a logistic regressor (or, in the case of multinomial distributions, a \"softmax\" regressor). See the architecture for the GoogLeNet for an explicit example. http://www.cs.unc.edu/~wliu/papers/GoogLeNet.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of logistic regression is that it may handle non-linear effects; plus, its interpretability is not much more complex than linear models. The model also makes very little assumptions about the underlying distribution. One disadvantage is that the MLE optimization routine can have trouble converging for certain problem instances, but these can often be addressed by tuning the learning rate or normalizing / rescaling the input data. Finally, the model relies on the discriminative power of existing features: this explains its utility in deep learning applications, where we use backprop and stochastic gradient descent to optimize the features learned by the model to acheive the best performance of the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this is a good fit for the problem for two main reasons. First, it is easy to interpret (later we will look at the coefficients derived from the learned model, and how they measure the relative the importance of the various predictor variables). Second, while we do not have a lot of data, I think we have enough to learn a good model, though probably not enough for more sophisticated techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machine\n",
    "------------\n",
    "Support vector machines seek a separating hyperplane between the positive and negative data points that maximizes the \"margin\": the goal is to maximize the minimum distance between any data point and the separating hyperplane. I think this technique could work well for this problem for a few reasons: (1) the model is inheretly a binary classifier; (2) the hyperplane is defined only in terms of the \"closest\" points, and so it should be (somewhat) robust to the skew in our distribution (there are more students who passed than failed). Next, (3) despite the hyperplane ultimately being a linear separator, the plane will in fact exist in \"kernel space\": an abstract space defined by a metric function of our choosing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this can lead to overfitting and an opaque interpretation. \n",
    "\n",
    "One real world use case of support vector machines is in high energy particle physics, in the problem of classifying \"interesting\" events (see \"Support Vector Machines in High Energy Physics\" https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2345).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "------------\n",
    "KNN works by making a prediction for each student based on the predictions of the \"most similar\" data points from training. This technique is limited in its scalability, since the memory requirements for the algorithm grow linearly with the training data. Given the size of our training data, this is not at present an issue. The assumption of the model is that points close together in feature space ought to have similar outcomes, which is not a bad assumption given the problem. I am including this technique as something of a baseline / sanity-check. Since the training time is virtually zero, it is very inexpensive to compare to our more scalable methods above. The low computational cost of prediciton and simplicity of the model are its strengths, and its lack of scalability is its main weakness. Another strength is that the learned function can incorporate non-linear aspects of the underlying distribution. Another weakness is that, over time, \"stale\" data points may be less relevant in predicting the outcome of nearby points, so continued use may require additional maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some digging, I found the following interesting use case of KNN: detecting transister failures  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3284325_Fault_Detection_Using_the_k-Nearest_Neighbor_Rule_for_Semiconductor_Manufacturing_Processes . Another more familiar example is KNN being used by Spotify for music recommendations. https://github.com/spotify/annoy"
